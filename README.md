Data-centric API

This plugin provides a cached data-centric view of a Wordpress site enabling Wordpress to be used as a content management system (back-end "model") for a separately implemented user interface (front-end "view" and "controller"). The data is exchanged using JSON structures that are cached in server files and served via a PHP-based API to improve front-end performance
